# C# Practice Tasks with Else If Statements

This project demonstrates how to use `if / else if / else` conditions in beginner-level C# tasks.
Each task includes conditional logic for evaluation and categorization.

## ✅ Task 1: Employee Salary Levels

**Objective:**
- Ask the user to enter their name and monthly salary.
